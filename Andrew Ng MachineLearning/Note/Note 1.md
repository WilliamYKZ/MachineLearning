# Note 1

1. Mechine Learning
   - Grew out of work in AI
   - New capability for computer



2. Some example of mechine leaning
   - Database mining: large datasets from growth of automation/web. Like Web click data, we can use this data to know what people like or what they want in internet. **We can use mechine learning to have better understand of data**.
   - Applications can't program by hand.  such as autonomous helicopter, handwriting recognition, more of Natural Language Processing(NLP), and computer vision. Those situtation have **too many changing variables ** that people can not write every cases by hand. So we need mechine to leanring and develop solution in different cases.  
   - Self-customizing programs: Like recommendations algorithm. 



3. Mechine Learning Definition
   - By Arthur Samuel:Field of study that gives computers the ability to learn **without** being explicitly programmed.
   - By Tom Mitchell (1998) Well-posed Learning Problem: A computer program is said to learn from experience $E$ with respect to some task $T$ and some performance measure $P$, if its performance on $T$, as measured by $P$, improves with experience $E$.



4. Supervised Learning

 we give the algorithm a data set in which the right answers were given. and we want the algorithm give us more of right answers. there are 

- **regression problem**, to predicct continuous valued output. 
- **Classification**: it have discrete valued output. (0 or 1)



5. Unsupervised Learning

 There is not label in data. can we find some structure in the data? 

- **Clustering algorithm**

For example in google news, in same topic there will be many different news from different news paper or company. google news can let different news show in the same topic.
