# Supervised Leaning

1. You give your learning algorithm example to learn from. Includes the right answer, whereby right anwer. (You need to give correct answer $y$ with in put $x$).

## Regression

Predict a number, infinitely many possible outputs

## Classification

predict categories, small number of possible outputs.

2. Any supervised learning model that predicts a number such as 220,000 or 1.5 or negative 33.2 is addressing what's called a regression problem.
