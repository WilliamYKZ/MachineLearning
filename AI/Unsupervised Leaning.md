# Unsupervised Leaning

1. Find some interesting in unlabeled data.
2. Data only comes with input $x$, but not output labels $y$.
3. Algorithm has to fine **structure** in the data. 



## Clustering algorithm

1. it place the unlabeled data, into different clusters.

### Example: Google News

1. Since the google news will get lots of new a day, they use unsupervised leaning to divide news in different clusters.  



## Anomaly detection

1. find unusual data point. 





## Dimensionality reduction

1. compress data using fewer numbers.
